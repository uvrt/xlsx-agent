"""xlsx-agent: workbooks as a source an agent can describe, query and derive from.

The agent never writes XML and never does arithmetic: it reads a catalogue of the workbook,
asks for rows, and asks the library for figures, each of which says which cells it came
from.  Built on lxml, ooxml-edit and ooxml-common, beside pptx-agent and docx-agent.

So far a workbook opens, lists its sheets and writes itself back unchanged::

    from xlsx_agent import Workbook

    wb = Workbook.open("inventory.xlsx")      # bytes, a path, or an OpcPackage
    wb.sheets                                  # [Sheet(name='Stock', id=3, state='visible', ...)]

A ``.xls``, ``.xlsb`` or encrypted file is refused with an :class:`OpenError` whose
``code`` says why.  See ROADMAP.md for the plan and what each milestone adds.
